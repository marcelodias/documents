Padrao no > 8.4

1. Create new User in PostgreSQL ,for example monitor (you don't have to grant any special roles to this users AFAIK,
any user has access to Statistic Tables). *configurar a senha monitor 
2. Try to connect remotely under this user to postgres Database: 
psql -h YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST -U monitor -W postgres 
and try execute following SQL: 
select * from pg_stat_all_tables; 
If everything work proceed with installation otherwise fix your problem till you get results. 

3. Cacti Import 
pgsql_stats.php - the Script, put this in <cacti_root>/scripts/ 
postgres_dbstat.xml - the Definition, put this in <cacti_root>/resource/script_queries 
cacti_data_query_postgresql_database_stats.xml - Data Query + Graphs - import into Cacti 

4. Edit pgsql_stats.php line 173 and 174 and put username and password you have created at point 1. (I don't know how to
pass username and password parameters to Data Queries. If you know how, let me know so I can remote username and
password from script) 
 
   Note: se a senha é monitor, não precisa mudar o script

5. Edit your Host Template or Device and add PostgreSQL Database Stats in Data Queries.
