# HIGH-SPEED VERSION - requires lynx or wget !!
# If you don't have either, please use the default version.
#
# Version 0.4 - PLEASE SEE README.txt and TUNING.txt for more information.
#
# USAGE:
#
# perl unix_apachestats.pl <hostname>
#
# <hostname> is optional and can be an IP address or host name.
#            If none is given, "localhost" is assumed.
#            The cacti configuration should normally take care of this..
#
# LOCAL SETTINGS:
#
# I've found wget to be the most efficient, but if you're not so fussy
# about speed, and/or would rather stick to lynx, you may change the default
# below:
#

$RETRIEVER="/usr/bin/wget --user-agent=\"ApacheStats\/0.4 wget\/1.8\" -q -O - -t3 -T5";
#$RETRIEVER="/usr/bin/lynx -useragent=\"ApacheStats\/0.4 Lynx\/2.8\" -dump";

# Change the following if you have an environment variable of "http_proxy"
# that interferes with your direct access to the web server in question.
# The symptoms are that the ACL on the server disallows you access because
# you are connecting via a proxy server:

delete $ENV{'HTTP_PROXY'};
delete $ENV{'http_proxy'};

#
# YOU SHOULDN"T NEED TO CHANGE ANYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT..

# First get hold of any supplied hostname, otherwise set to "localhost"

# Run the query:

$output = `$RETRIEVER $URL`;
